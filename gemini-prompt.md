# Version 1

**Goal:** Create a high-resolution, full-color digital illustration of a doctor for a custom desk standee. The final image must be a **highly recognizable illustrated portrait** of the individual in the **[Attached Source Photo]**, with the body and attire rendered **in the artistic style of** the **[Attached Style Reference]** illustration.

**1. Subject & Role:**
* A professional **Doctor/Physician** (Gender should be automatically determined by the Source Photo).
* **Expression:** Pleasant, approachable, confident smile. Eyes looking directly at the viewer.

**2. Standardized Attire & Pose (Style Reference Format):**
* **Attire:** Wearing a crisp, white **Lab Coat** (or doctor's apron) over **dark blue scrubs/v-neck top**.
* **Accessories:** A silver and black **Stethoscope** draped around the neck.
* **Pose:** Three-quarter profile, with **arms crossed** over the chest.
* **Background:** **Color Hex code #8DC5FE** or a transparent PNG (if possible) for easy cutting/isolation. 

**3. Integration & Style (Lighter Theme):**
* **Style:** **Semi-Realistic Illustrated Portrait** for a standee. The overall style should maintain the **clean lines, defined shapes, and smooth, professional shading** of the **[Attached Style Reference]**, but applied to the facial features with a lighter touch, leaning toward **semi-photorealistic likeness** rendered in the illustration technique.
* **Face Detail Retention:** The system must use the **Close match facial structure, unique realistic features, subtle expressions, and natural proportions** from the **[Source Photo]**.
    * **Objective:** **Preserve the individual's unique facial characteristics and photographic identity with the highest possible fidelity.** Stylize the face **minimally**, only enough to harmonize with the illustration style of the body. **Absolutely prevent any cartoonization, exaggeration, or distortion of facial features.** The face must retain its **realistic character.**
    * **Emphasis:** Retain the **photographic accuracy and distinct likeness (IDENTITY)** of the individual as much as possible, translating it into the illustrated medium without losing their unique character.
* **Hair Integration:** Hair color, style, volume, and texture from the **[Source Photo]** should be **accurately and realistically represented**, translated into the semi-realistic illustration style.
* **Seamless Blend:** The head and neck must be rendered in the exact artistic style (line-work, color palette, texture, and shading consistency) as the illustrated body to ensure a **smooth, seamless, and natural transition** at the neck/collar.
* **Proportion:** The head size should be realistic and proportional to the body, avoiding caricature-level exaggeration.

**Focus Keyword Emphasis:** **Photographic Likeness Retention (Primary Focus)**, **Realistic Character**, **Minimal Stylization**, **Semi-Realistic Illustration**, **Seamless Integration**, **Consistent Art Style**.

**4. Technical Specifications:**
* **Output Format:** Digital Illustration, **High-Resolution (Print-Ready)**.
* **Pixel Dimensions:** **1800 x 2667 pixels (600 DPI equivalent).**
* **Aspect Ratio & Composition:** **0.67:1 Vertical Portrait.**
    * **CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE:** The illustration must **exactly match the scale, composition, and framing of the [Attached Style Reference] image.** The subject's body should fill the vertical frame **edge-to-edge** according to the reference, occupying the **entire 1800 x 2667 pixel canvas**.
    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** **ABSOLUTELY NO ADDED PADDING, WHITE SPACE, or MARGINS.** The final output image must be the exact size of the subject in the pose, cropped tightly like the **[Style Reference]**.
**No Extra words or any other content other than the subject in the output**

**Focus Keyword Emphasis:** **EXACT 1800x2667 PIXEL DIMENSION**, **Full Canvas Fill**, **No Padding**, **0.67:1 Aspect Ratio**, **Seamless Integration**, **Standardized Body**, **Smooth Transition at Neck**, **High-Resolution**.

## Version 3 (Old)

**Goal:** Create a high-resolution, full-color digital illustration of a doctor for a custom desk standee. The final image must seamlessly integrate the facial features and hairstyle from the [Attached Source Photo] onto the body and style of the [Attached Style Reference] illustration.



**1. Subject & Role:**

* A professional **Doctor/Physician** (Gender should be automatically determined by the Source Photo).

* **Expression:** Pleasant, approachable, confident smile. Eyes looking directly at the viewer.



**2. Standardized Attire & Pose (Mimic Style Reference):**

* **Attire:** Wearing a crisp, white **Lab Coat** (or doctor's apron) over **dark blue scrubs/v-neck top**.

* **Accessories:** A silver and black **Stethoscope** draped around the neck.

* **Pose:** Three-quarter profile, with **arms crossed** over the chest (as seen in the reference standee).

* **Background:** **Pure white** or a transparent PNG (if possible) for easy cutting/isolation. If a background is mandatory, use a minimal, light gray gradient.



**3. Integration & Style (Lighter Theme):**

* **Style:** **Semi-Realistic Illustrated Portrait** for a standee. The overall style should maintain the clean lines, defined shapes, and smooth, professional shading of the [Style Reference] illustration, but applied to the facial features with a lighter touch.

* **Face Detail Retention:** The system must use the **facial structure, unique features, realistic proportions, and subtle expressions** from the [Source Photo].

    * **Objective:** **Stylize the face just enough to match the illustration style of the body, NOT to cartoonize or exaggerate features.**

    * **Emphasis:** Retain the **photographic likeness** of the individual as much as possible, translating it into the illustrated medium without losing their distinct character.

* **Hair Integration:** Hair color, style, and volume from the [Source Photo] should be accurately represented, translated into the semi-realistic illustration style.

* **Seamless Blend:** The head and neck must be rendered in the exact artistic style (line-work, color palette, texture, and shading consistency) as the existing illustrated body to ensure a **smooth, seamless, and natural transition** at the neck/collar. Avoid any 'cut-and-paste' or abrupt stylistic changes.

* **Proportion:** The head size should be realistic and proportional to the body in the [Style Reference], avoiding caricature-level exaggeration.



**Focus Keyword Emphasis:** **Semi-Realistic Illustration**, **Photographic Likeness Retention**, **Subtle Stylization**, **Seamless Integration**, **Smooth Transition at Neck**, **Consistent Art Style**.



**4. Technical Specifications:**

* **Output Format:** Digital Illustration, High-Resolution (300 DPI equivalent for print).

* **Aspect Ratio:** Vertical, suitable for a standee (e.g., 2:3 or 3:4 portrait).



**Focus Keyword Emphasis:** **Seamless Integration**, **Integrated Caricature**, **Standardized Body**, **Smooth Transition at Neck**, **High-Resolution**.
